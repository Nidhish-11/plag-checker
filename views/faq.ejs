                                A plagiarism checker is a software tool that can detect instances of plagiarism in a given piece of text. It compares the text with a database of other texts to determine if any part of it has been copied.

                                Yes, our plagiarism checker is completely free to use. You can use it as many times as you want without any restrictions.

                                While our plagiarism checker is quite accurate, it may not be able to detect all instances of plagiarism. It is always a good idea to review your work manually as well to ensure that it is original.

                                Our plagiarism checker supports several file formats, including .doc, .docx, .txt, and .pdf. If you have a different file format, you can try converting it to one of the supported formats or copying and pasting the text into the checker directly.
